/*
 * Runs the CLI subprocess suites, isolated from the rest of the unit job, and
 * reports how long each case actually took as GitHub annotations.
 *
 * The timings are not decoration. Every Windows failure in these suites has
 * been a budget expiring, which censors the one number needed to tell "this
 * runner is slower than the budget" from "this child is wedged forever" - both
 * render as a duration a hair over the limit. Job logs need auth to fetch;
 * annotations do not, so the durations stay readable from the API on a pass as
 * well as a failure, and a regression shows up as a number rather than a shrug.
 *
 * See cli-subprocess-suites.ts for why these run apart from test:ci.
